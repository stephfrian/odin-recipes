        <h2>Lemonade's Beauty</h2>

        <h3> Lemonade is so terrific because it is thirst-quenching, sweet, tart, and sour all at once. It is pretty easy to make, only requiring minimal ingredients, like lemons and sugar. Everyone needs to try lemonade at least once in their lifetime!</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>9 medium lemons, or more if necessary</li>
            <li>7 cups ice-cold water</li>
            <li>ice, as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place sugar and 1 cup water in small saucepan. Stir the mixture until
                the sugar dissolves and the mix comes to a boil. Then set the mix
            aside. </li>
            <li> Soften lemons by rolling them. Cut each of them in half crosswise and squeeze
                the lemons into a liquid measuring cup. You can add pulp to your juice, but throw away
                any seeds. Juice the lemons until you end up with 1 1/2 cups of juice and
                pulp.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour 7 cups of ice-cold water into a pitcher. Stir in the lemon juice and pulp,
                then finally add the simple syrup mix to taste. Add ice as needed.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
