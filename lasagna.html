        <h2>Lasagna's greatness </h2>

        <h3>Lasagna is amazing because it brings together so many comforting 
            flavors and textures. The soft layers of pasta, rich sauce, creamy 
            ricotta, melty mozzarella, and savory fillings create the perfect 
            bite every time. Those crispy edges give it a satisfying crunch, 
            while the cheesy, hearty layers make it feel extra indulgent. What 
            really makes it special, though, is the care and effort that goes 
            into making it—it’s more than just food, it’s a little slice of 
            love.</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>ground beef/Italian sausage</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of red wine</li>
            <li>marinara sauce</li>
            <li>dried thyme</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>parsley</li>
            <li>lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>cottage cheese</li>
            <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Brown the beef</li>
            <li>Create the sauce: Add the wine to a pan and stir until almost
                evaporated. Add marinara sauce, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley.
                Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook the sauce for 5 minutes
            </li>
            <li>Make the cheese filling: Combine cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup
                mozzarella cheese in a mixing bowl (save the rest for later)
            </li>
            <li>Prep: Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit, cook lasagna noodles
                in well-salted water until al dente. Drain and pour in cold water.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna in a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Layer by first adding the meat,
                followed by 3 noodles, then 1/3 of the meat sauce, then 1 cup mozzarella, then half
                of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the final layer, add 3 noodles,
                1/3 meat sauce, and the rest of the mozzarella.
            </li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil, then bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. Remove foil
                and broil for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is slightly brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let lasagna rest for 30 minutes prior to cutting and serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
